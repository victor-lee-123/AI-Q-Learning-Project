AI Project - Deep Q Learning algorithm and exe files with documentation

=======================================================
# ‚≠ê Introduction 
Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant traction in recent years as a powerful
framework for decision-making in games and interactive simulations. At the heart of this
field lies Q-learning, a foundational algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal behavior
through trial and error. Whether you're developing stealth AI, dynamic enemy combatants,
or procedural puzzle solvers, Q-learning offers an intuitive entry point into autonomous
game AI - one that requires no prior model of the environment and yet produces
impressively adaptable results.

# ‚≠ê What is this research about?
This research explores Q-learning as both a stepping stone and a key building block of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). We'll break down how Q-learning works, why its relevant
to game developers, and how it scales into more powerful neural-network-driven systems
like Deep Q-Networks (DQN). Along the way, we'll cover concepts such as state-action
value estimation, policy optimization, and experience replay - but always with a focus on
how this applies to practical, real-time gameplay situations. The goal is to equip you with a
working understanding of how to implement and extend Q-learning, not just as a classroom
algorithm, but as a real design tool for emergent game mechanics and intelligent behavior.
